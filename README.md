# Question answering

This project implements a question answering system using Wikipedia as a resource. The system that performs document retrieval is Wikipedia's own [elastic search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elasticsearch) engine. The model that does reading comprehension is [BERT](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.04805) fine-tuned on Wikipedia, courtesy of the [transformers](https://huggingface.co/transformers/) library ðŸ¥°


## Install

Run as a Python module (QA results are slow):

- `pip install -r requirements-dev.txt`
- `run tests xxx`

Run as a separate model server:

- docker pull
- docker run
- add `Answerer(model_server="localhost:8888")` to module

## Under the hood

Question answering systems all operate in two steps:

- find some relevant documents. This process is called _document retrieval_ and the software that does this is called a _search engine_. This is implemented in `document_retrieval.py`.
- read through the documents and find the answer. This process is called _reading comprehension_ and is performed by a model like BERT. This is implemented in `reading_comprehension.py`

Additionally, there are a number of odds and ends that need to be tied up. This is all done in the `answer_question.py` module:

- chunking the retrieved documents into pieces that are small enough to be evaluated by the model.
- deciding which of the model's evaluations contains the correct answer.
